  <description value="This is the Belgian profile for a laboratory order." />
  <purpose value="Initially, this profile is created for the unadressed flow for laboratory orders. &#xD;&#xA;These existing channels: via a specialized laboratory application, running on the environment of the ordering party, via the own application of the ordering party in which that own application places the order directly at the laboratory using a custom protocol, via the website of a laboratory or via a paper channel are initially out of scope for use of this profile. They might however benefit from using this format in the future." />
