   <p>It is noted here, the physical workflow concerning the specimen is considered out of scope in this implementation guide.
   To enable any future initiative to deal with specimen, this guide does provide a national identifier naming system but it is fully
   expected there will be instances of the laboratory prescription
   where no specimen identifier is known at the time of making the prescription.</p>
   <h4>Intent/status of prescription</h4>
   <p>A laboratory prescription might use different specific elements depending on the workflow. It SHALL be noted this is of
course limited to what is possible concerning when the specimen was accepted</p>
<li>
   <ul>The .status normally remains 'active' until the request is fulfilled. If needed the status can be changed to 'revoked' or 'entered-in-error' to cancel the request.</ul>
<ul>The original order of a laboratory prescription SHALL be made by having .intent as 'original-order'</ul>
<ul>Appending the request with extra orders can be done by using the intent 'order' and referencing the original order using the .basedOn element </ul>
<ul>Replacing the order can be done by using the intent 'order' and referencing the original order using the .replaces element</ul>
<ul>If needed, the .intent can be 'reflex-order' or 'filler-order' with a reference to the original order using the .basedOn element</ul>
